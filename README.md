# 👋 Hi, I'm Mahtab  
### Data Analyst | Physics MSc | Sales Analytics | EEG Time-Series | Machine Learning

I'm a data-driven analyst with a unique background combining **Physics (BSc in Nuclear Engineering + MSc)**, **Sales Data Analytics**, and **scientific data analysis**.  
I enjoy cleaning messy datasets, finding meaningful patterns, and communicating insights through dashboards and visual storytelling.

## 🧠 My Background

- I completed my **Bachelor’s in Nuclear Engineering** and later my **Master’s in Physics**.  
- In Iran, I worked on an academic research project at **University of Zanjan**, analyzing **EEG time-series data of patients with ADD/ADHD** using signal processing and statistical techniques.  
- At the same time, I worked in a **commercial oil & gas company**, first as a **quality control engineer**, and later—because of my attention to detail and interest in data—as a **Sales Data Analyst**. I analyzed sales reports, product performance, and business trends.  
- After immigrating to Canada, I completed my **MSc in Physics**, where my research focused on **training Energy-Based Models (EBMs)** using deep learning.  
- Because of my strong passion for data, I recently completed the **Data Analytics program at BrainStation**, strengthening my skills in Excel, SQL, Python, Tableau, and business analysis.

I combine scientific thinking with real-world business analytics — a combination that helps me understand data from both technical and strategic perspectives.
